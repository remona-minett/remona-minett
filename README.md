### Hi! I'm Remona. Let's make the world a better place.

I want to learn to code in most common languages eventually, so that I can work with others to create great games and utilities for all.

Currently, I'm working with the developers of Space Station 13 Idle on their game to add cool features and fix bugs. At the moment, I'm learning C#, JS, and a little Vue.
